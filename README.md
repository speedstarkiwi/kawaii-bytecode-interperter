# kawaii-bytecode-interperter

`kawaii bytecode interperter` is written in lua and both c++, it allows to call a function from the `init` script but will only run `lua bytecode` format. for you lua `nerdies` out there, `_G` is used to run it.

`lua bytecocde interperters` refered to **LBI** hit it's highest peak in the mid months of 2021, almost all exploits using it, sadly, it **died**.
